# FutureCostFunction
The hydro class is designed to facilitate hydrothermal dispatch optimization, allowing users to model and solve one-stage hydrothermal dispatch problems. It offers methods for computing future cost functions and solving hydrothermal dispatch problems under various constraints and parameters.

Features
Hydrothermal Dispatch Optimization: The class enables the modeling and optimization of one-stage hydrothermal dispatch problems, considering factors such as cost for thermal generation, turbine capacities, maximum storage, efficiency, and more.
Piecewise Linear Future Cost Function Computation: Users can compute piecewise linear future cost functions for a given time horizon, considering inflow scenarios and demand variations.
